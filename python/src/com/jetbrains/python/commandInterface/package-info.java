/**
 * View/Presenter pair that implements so-called "command line interface".
 * It has several abilities, including (but not limited):
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Suggestion box</li>
 *   <li>Error emphasising</li>
 *   <li>Popups</li>
 *   <li>AutoCompletion</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 *   System consists of {@link com.jetbrains.python.commandInterface.CommandInterfacePresenter}
 *   and appropriate {@link com.jetbrains.python.commandInterface.CommandInterfaceView}.
 *   See {@link com.jetbrains.python.vp} for more info.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   There is also swing-based view implementation in {@link com.jetbrains.python.commandInterface.swingView}
 *   and presenter implementation based on idea of commands with arguments. See {@link com.jetbrains.python.commandInterface.rangeBasedPresenter}
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Presenter and View talk to each other only in term of text and chars. Presenter knows nothing about pixels and should never
 *   assume view have certain pixel size.
